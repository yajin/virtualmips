#Binary. It means virtualmips direct boots the image from ROM or flash. The entry pc is 0x1fc00000. The image contains bootloader and kernel/rootfs. 
#ELF. It means virtualmips reads an elf image(setten by kernel_file_name) into sdram and then boots from elf entry point. The elf image contains kernel and rootfs.
